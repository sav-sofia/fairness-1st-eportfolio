New school year, new classmates. Honestly, I didn't like the idea of being in the "star section" of grade 9. I was separated from my friends and I have new classmates. I only knew few of my
classmates since I knew them from grade 7. Surprisingly, I got along with my class pretty well. It's only been a month since classes started but it already feels like I've been in grade 9 for
a year now. It's been fun and stressful learning new things. I hope I can survive this school year.<br><br>

<h3 align="center"><b>REFLECTION</b></h3>
<p>Honestly, I really enjoyed the first quarter. I got to make new friends and got to learn new things. ICT class was a roller coaster of emotions. Sometimes it was hard, sometimes it was easy. But overall, I had fun learning the subjects, especially when Ms. Uminga teaches us. She's a fun, energetic, and considerate teacher. My classmates and I would make jokes with her and she would join in! I really adore Ms. She's one of the teachers that I enjoy being with. I hope that Ms. Uminga will be more energetic in the next quarters. I love her to the bone.<3
